1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
[Translated to fr] ...should he have, Colonel?

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,060
[Translated to fr] You snotty little bastard.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,840
[Translated to fr] [Ross] Your Honor, I'd like to ask for a recess.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,420
[Translated to fr] I'd like an answer to the question, Judge.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,180
[Translated to fr] The court will wait for an answer.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,660
[Translated to fr] If Lieutenant Kendrick, gave an order...
[Translated to fr] that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,320
[Translated to fr] ...then why did he have to be transferred?

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,500
[Translated to fr] Colonel?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,600
[Translated to fr] Lt. Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't he,
[Translated to fr] because *that's* what you told Lt. Kendrick to do!

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,100
[Translated to fr] [Ross] Object!

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,900
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose!

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,020
[Translated to fr] [Randolph] That will be all, Counsel.
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose!

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,660
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose!

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,160
[Translated to fr] [Ross] Your Honor!

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,900
[Translated to fr] [Randolph] Counsel, I'll hold you in contempt!
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order!

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,400
[Translated to fr] [Ross] YOUR HONOR!
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order!

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,440
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You doctored the log book!

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,120
[Translated to fr] [Ross] DAMMIT, KAFFEE!
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You coerced the doctor! Now I'm asking you!

19
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,620
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You coerced the doctor! Now I'm asking you!

20
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,080
[Translated to fr] [Randolph] Consider yourself in contempt!
[Translated to fr] [Kaffee] You coerced the doctor! Now I'm asking you!

21
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,200
[Translated to fr] COLONEL JESSUP! DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED?!

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,680
[Translated to fr] You don't have to answer that question!

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,300
[Translated to fr] I'll answer the question.

24
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,940
[Translated to fr] You want answers?!

25
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,000
[Translated to fr] I think I'm entitled to--

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
[Translated to fr] [Jessup] *You want answers*?!

27
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,340
[Translated to fr] I WANT THE TRUTH!

28
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,520
[Translated to fr] *You can't handle the truth*!

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,380
[Translated to fr] Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those
[Translated to fr] walls have to be guarded by men with guns.

30
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,200
[Translated to fr] Who's gonna do it? You?(!) You, Lt. Weinberg?(!)

31
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,440
[Translated to fr] I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom!

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,840
[Translated to fr] You weep for Santiago and you
[Translated to fr] curse the Marines. You have that luxury.

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,540
[Translated to fr] You have the luxury of not knowing what I know:
[Translated to fr] That Santiago's death - while tragic - *probably* saved lives!

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,340
[Translated to fr] And my existence - while grotesque and
[Translated to fr] incomprehensible to you - *saves lives*!

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,740
[Translated to fr] You don't want the truth, because deep down
[Translated to fr] in places you don't talk about at parties...

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,980
[Translated to fr] You *want* me on that wall.
[Translated to fr] You *need* me on that wall.

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,160
[Translated to fr] We use words like "honor", "code", "loyalty".

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,240
[Translated to fr] We use this words as the backbone
[Translated to fr] of a life spent *defending* something.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
[Translated to fr] You use them as a punchline!

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,120
[Translated to fr] I have neither the time, nor the inclination to explain myself

41
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,460
[Translated to fr] to a man who rises and sleeps under the
[Translated to fr] blanket of the very freedom that I provide

42
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,320
[Translated to fr] and then *questions* the manner in which I provide it!

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
[Translated to fr] I would rather you just said "thank you", and went on your way.

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,420
[Translated to fr] Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,380
[Translated to fr] *Either way, I don't give a DAMN
[Translated to fr] what you think you are entitled to*!

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,980
[Translated to fr] Did you order the code red?

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,020
[Translated to fr] [Jessup] I did the job--

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,160
[Translated to fr] DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED?!

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,300
[Translated to fr] *YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID*!!
