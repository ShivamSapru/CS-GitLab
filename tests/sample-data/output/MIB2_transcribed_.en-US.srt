1
0:00:01,280 --> 0:00:03,040
And I'll learn to get along.

2
0:00:03,040 --> 0:00:06,040
And so you're back from outer space.

3
0:00:06,800 --> 0:00:10,440
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.

4
0:00:10,440 --> 0:00:12,200
I should have changed that stupid lock.

5
0:00:12,320 --> 0:00:14,120
I should have made you leave your teeth.

6
0:00:14,440 --> 0:00:17,960
If I'd known for just one second, you'd be back to bottom me.

7
0:00:17,960 --> 0:00:18,680
Go on now.

8
0:00:18,680 --> 0:00:21,200
Go walk out the door, Frank.

9
0:00:22,840 --> 0:00:25,880
Bring your head in this window before I roll it up in there.

10
0:00:26,520 --> 0:00:26,840
Got it.
